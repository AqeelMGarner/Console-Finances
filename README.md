# Console-Finances

## Description
My motivation in building this application was to show the financal analysis over the years for this business. The reason i built this application was to calculate and document the total months given to me, total amount of profit/losses over the entire period, the average of the changes in profit/losses, the greatest increase in profits and the greatest decrease in losses. The problem my application solves is that it is  transferable and can easily be changed to fit the needs of the user. the user can add more data or take it away the code will adapt to produce the correct answer. What i learned in the making of this appliction was to use more descriptive variables to make the code adaptive.
